The following steps will guide you to execute the files that are contained in HW2.zip folder.

Steps to run the program:

1) Unzip the folder on your system.
2) The input images on which the computation is performed must be present in the folder HW1.
3) Open terminal. Do cd <address of the folder>.
4) Type 'make'. Press Enter.
5) Now write: 
   a.exe <inputfile.raw> <outputfile.raw> <bytesPerPixel><imageWidth <imageHeight> 

  Only in case of 11. Stitching
  Write: <inputfile.raw> <middleFile.raw> <rightFile.raw> <outputFile.raw> <bytesPerPixel>


6)
Choose one: 
1. Color to Grayscale Conversion
2. CMY conversion
3. Bilinear interpolation
4. Histogram equalization
5. Image Filtering : Creating Oil Painting Effect
6. Image Filtering :Creating Film Special Effect

14. Error Diffusion
15.Shrinking
16.Thinning/ Skeletonizing
17. Counting Game

7) Enter the one you want to implement. Press Enter. The output will be saved in HW2. 
8) You can view the output image using ImageJ.
